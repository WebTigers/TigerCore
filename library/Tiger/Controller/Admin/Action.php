 * Tiger_Controller_Admin_Action — the base for every ADMIN-shell controller.
 *
 * Any controller whose screens render inside the admin experience (the sidebar + top bar +
 * content well of the PUMA `admin` layout) extends this instead of Tiger_Controller_Action.
 * It sets the admin layout ONCE, in init(), so no admin controller hand-rolls
 * `$this->_helper->layout()->setLayout('admin')` — the layout is a property of "this is an
 * admin controller," not a line each author must remember. Core and every module's admin
 * controllers share it, so reskinning the admin layout/views reskins them all at once.
 *
 * A specific action that must escape the shell (e.g. a full-screen builder) still calls
 * `$this->_helper->layout()->disableLayout()` in that action — init sets the default, the
 * action overrides. Authorization is NOT here — it's the unbypassable Authorization plugin
 * (admin controllers are ACL-gated admin+ in their module's acl.ini). See ADMIN.md for the
 * screen template that goes on top of this.
